# Xing Lab

## Introduction 
The Xudong Xing research team pioneers the innovative application of bioinformatics theories, methodological frameworks, and integrated technical systems to address frontier challenges of biomedicine. The team’s research centers on deciphering the hallmarks and sex differences underlying cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes, aiming to accelerate the translational development of novel cancer treatment strategies. Lab members pursue multidisciplinary research to uncover how complex molecular circuits are organized, regulated, and reshaped by genetic and environmental influences, cellular differentiation, and disease.
In recent years, they have published 10 articles in top-tier journals, including Nature (2024), Cancer Cell (2025, 2024), Science Immunology (2023), Science Translational Medicine (2022), Science Advances (2021), and Nature Immunology (2020). These studies have received over 3,000 citations, with four papers designated as ESI Top 1% Highly Cited Papers. The team’s work has been highlighted in leading journals, including Cancer Cell (two articles), Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, and Cancer Discovery.
