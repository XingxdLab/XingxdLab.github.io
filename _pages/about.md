We innovatively applies the theories, methods, and technical systems of bioinformatics to explore interdisciplinary frontiers in biomedicine. The team focuses on deciphering the key characteristics and sex differences in various stages of cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Deciphering the Hallmarks and Sex Differences in Cancer), tackling the critical and challenging task of identifying and functionally characterizing key biomarkers in the field of precision medicine, thereby contributing to the development and translation of novel cancer treatment strategies. In recent years, the team has published 10 first-author (including co-first-author) papers in academic journals such as Nature (2024), Cancer Cell (2025, 2024), Science Immunology (2023), Science Translational Medicine (2022), Science Advances (2021), and Nature Immunology (2020). The total academic citations exceed 2,900, with four papers recognized as ESI Top 1% highly cited publications. The research findings have been featured in the 2024 Yearbook of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, highlighted as editor's research highlights, ranked among the Top 5 hot papers on PubMed, and received dedicated reviews in authoritative journals in the field, including Cancer Cell (two papers), Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, and Cancer Discovery. Currently, as the project leader, Xing Xudong is overseeing the National Key Research and Development Program for Young Scientists, the National Natural Science Foundation of China General Program, and the Beijing Science and Technology Rising Star Talent Program.
